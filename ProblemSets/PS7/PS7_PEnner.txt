The log wage data is missing at a rate of 25.12 percent. It appears to be missing
at random. There appears to be more missingness for women who are married,
have high tenure, or college degree. None of this missingness is complete, so the
data can reasonably be imputed.
Every method underestimated the true value of the parameter. Linear,
PMM, and complete cases all got equally close however.

I have been really swamped so I haven't looked to closely at my project. But I
want to work with that NFL combine data I had in the last homework. I'm not
sure how I want to model it yet, but expect the interaction between predictors
will be important. So Trees or a neural networks might be good routes.
