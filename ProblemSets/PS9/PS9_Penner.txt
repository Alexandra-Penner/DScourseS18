\section{data}
the training data is 404 observations of 450 features

\section{lasso}
The in sample RMSE is 0.178, out of sample is RMSE 0.1899799, The optimal value of lambda is 0.00457.

\section{ridge}
The in sample RMSE is 0.164, out of sample is RMSE 0.1872715, The optimal value of lambda is 0.3.

\section{elastic net}
The in sample RMSE is 0.163, out of sample is RMSE 0.1844383, The optimal value of lambda is 0.132.

\section{}
Traditional OLS is useless for this data because there are so many columns.  The curse of dimensionality prevents us from making a viable model with all features.  The error in the out of sample is only a little higher that in sample.
